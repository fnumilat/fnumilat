### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

## Why did I chose to become a Web Developer?

The applications and programs that I have been using to conduct inventory and purchase inventory at my current job as well as the applications that I have been using on my phone and PC not only have left me fascinated by how much they have made things easier for us to perform but also curious that how they are all being built. The fascination and curiosity are what made me to start this new journey to not only learn but also create programs and applications that can make things more easier for the community and the entire world.
